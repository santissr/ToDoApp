# ToDoApp

--This is the first commit.

It's a task management application where you can add tasks, mark them as completed, edit them, delete them, and search for them.

This is a project that helps me practice managing React's Context, portals, and local states. In addition to that, I used localStorage to store these tasks on the user's computer.
